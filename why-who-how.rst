Why, Who and How
================

Writing a book is done to achieve a goal [Why] (mostly make some money or being famous in the community) for a target audience [Who] with an optimal way [How] (Being famous would be great for me).

Here is some explanations:

Why writing Yet Another Methodology Book?

Every book talking about high level problem (design, methodology, etc.) in programming rely heavily on Java. I get bored. Then, write a python one.
The other goal is to write somehow a summary of the many methodology, their consistancy together and write something readable. Read 600 pages and 
finally remember 5. I tried to write this book on 6 pages (and hope your will still remember 5).

Who is the expected attendee?

I think the main audience, or at least the audience this book is written for, is python hackers who want to be lead to a more professional approach
of python. The best benefit from this book should be for people working on middle size project involving 3 to 5 people, when you reach the point where any time you fix a bug, a new ticket is created.

How to read this book?

Switch from part to part, read it cover to cover. No idea, we all have our own way of reading. But if one part should be read, read the TDD one.
That's the first stone of the pyramid.

Why this section?
Euh,.. look professional and serious, add an extra page and avoid a therapist.
